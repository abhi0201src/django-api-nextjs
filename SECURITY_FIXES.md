# Security Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Django Secret Key Security (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: Hardcoded secret key in `settings.py` flagged by Bandit
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated Django settings to use environment variables
  - Added `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` to GitHub secrets requirements
  - Configured pipeline to pass secret key to containers

### 2. Security Scan Configuration
- **Problem**: Bandit was scanning third-party code (node_modules) and failing on assert statements
- **Solution**:
  - Created `.bandit` configuration file 
  - Updated pipeline to exclude third-party directories
  - Skip B101 (assert_used) warnings for test files

### 3. Environment Variable Management
- **Problem**: DEBUG and other settings were hardcoded
- **Solution**:
  - Made DEBUG environment-aware
  - Added proper environment variable passing in pipeline
  - Updated Terraform to inject secrets into containers

## Files Modified

### Core Security
- `RestaurantCore/settings.py` - Environment-based configuration
- `.bandit` - Security scan configuration
- `SECRETS_SETUP.md` - Security setup documentation

### Pipeline Security
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Updated test step and environment variables
- `PIPELINE_README.md` - Added security documentation

## Testing Results

✅ **Django Configuration**: No issues with environment variables  
✅ **Security Scan**: Bandit passes with 0 issues  
✅ **Frontend Build**: Next.js builds successfully  
✅ **Dependency Check**: Safety scan ready  

## Next Steps

1. **Set up GitHub secrets** using `SECRETS_SETUP.md`
2. **Test the pipeline** with a real deployment
3. **Monitor CloudWatch** for any security alerts
4. **Rotate secrets regularly** as per security best practices

## Security Best Practices Applied

- Environment variable management for sensitive data
- Proper exclusion of third-party code from security scans
- Comprehensive dependency vulnerability checking
- Secure secret management through GitHub Actions
- Production-ready Django configuration
